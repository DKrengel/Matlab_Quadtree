OVERVIEWExample program for the Quadtree-algorithm based on a rotating drum with ~1600 free polygonal particles and ~280 wall elements.For simplicity and easy visualisation, the program is implemented in MATLAB.USAGEcall the program with "main".The simulation parameters can be changed in "main.m".If a different setup is desired, the particle and wall positions can be redefined in "DEM_initial_blender.m"NOTES1. The main driver for the quadtree formalism is "neighborhoodAlgorithm_QTree.m"2. For simplicity all Quadtree related files / subroutines start with QTree_ so that relevant files can be found more easily.3. In "neighborhoodAlgorithm_QTree.m" a visualisation subroutine can be enabled that plots the simulated configuration together with its   associated bounding boxes and quadtree structure (see qtree_example.png in the directory)4. For reference purposes, the sort-and-sweep neighborhood routines are included in the directory and can be enabled in the program with     [col_list, col_list_len] = neighborhood_algorithm(particleSide, particleX, particleY);   instead of the quadtree neighborhood routineLITERATUREThe DEM implementation is based on the Monograph "Understanding the Discrete Element Method" by H.-G. Matuttis and J.Chen, see the reference list in the .pdf article in the folder.The Quadtree formalism is described in the .pdf article located in this directory.REQUIREMENTSAny MATLAB version should be fine.No toolboxes are required.Tested with1. Windows 11, MATLAB 24.2.0.2863752 (R2024b) Update 5CONTACT:For questions or issues related to this program please contact the authors listed in the corresponding paper.UPDATE HISTORY:2026/02/18: Initial version prepared
